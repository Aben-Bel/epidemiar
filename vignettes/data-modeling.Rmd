# Input Data Formats, Model Specifications, and Event Detection Parameters


## Data & Data Formats

The epidemiar modeling and code requires 3 main sets of data: 

* epidemiological data, 
* daily environmental data, and 
* historical environmental reference data, 

plus several information/reference/specification inputs. 

### Epidemiology Data

For the epidemiology data, you will need weekly case counts of the disease/illness per the geographic unit (group) with population values (to calculate incidence). 

When calling the epidemiar function:

* `epi_data`:  Data table/tibble of epidemiological data with case numbers per week, with date field labeled as "obs_date". The date should be the _last_ day of the epidemiological week. Must contain columns for `casefield`, `populationfield`, and `groupfield`. It may contain other variables/columns, but these are ignored. 
* `casefield`: Give the field name for the case counts.
* `populationfield`:  Give the population field to give population numbers over time. It is used to calculated incidence, and also optionally used in Farrington method for populationOffset.
* `groupfield`:  Give the field name for districts or area divisions of epidemiological AND environmental data. If there are no groupings (all one area), user should give a field with the same value throughout the entire datasets. 
* `inc_per`: At what rate should incidence be calculated for? Default is "1000", meaning x cases per 1000 population. 
* `week_type`: For the "obs_date" in `epi_data`, you need to specify if you are using "CDC" epiweeks, or ISO-8601 ("ISO") standard weeks of the year (what WHO uses), the default assumption is ISO. The date should be the _last_ day of the epidemiological week.

#### Missing Data

There should be a line for each week and geographic grouping, even for missing data (i.e. explicit missing data). 
Any missing data will be filled in by linear interpolation inside of the epidemiar modeling functions. 

### Environmental Data

For the environmental data, daily data is expected for each environmental variable for each geographic unit. Based on the lag length chosen, you must have at least that number of days _before_ the first epidemiology data date.  

When calling the epidemiar function:

* `env_data`:  Data table/tibble of environmental data values for each geographic grouping, with date field labeled as "obs_date".
* `groupfield`:  Give the field name for districts or area divisions of epidemiological AND environmental data. If there are no groupings (all one area), user should provide a field with the same value throughout the entire datasets. 
* `obsfield`: Give the field name of the environmental data observation types.
* `valuefield`: Give the field name of the value of the environmental data observations.

#### Non-daily or Missing Data

If you do not have daily data (e.g. weekly, or irregular data), or have implicit missing data, you can use the 'data_to_daily()' function to add any missing rows. This function will also use linear interpolation to fill in values if possible (default 'interpolate = TRUE').  It is not recommended if you have a lot of missing/non-daily data. It will group on every field in the dataset that is not `obs_date`, or the user-given `valuefield`. Note: this will not fill out ragged data (different end dates of environmental variable data), but that will be handled inside of epidemiar. 


### Environmental Reference / Weekly Climate Data

The environmental reference / climate data should contain a reference value (column "ref_value") of the environmental variable per geographic group for each week of the year. For example, this could be the historical mean for that week of the year. 

* `groupfield`: Geographic grouping field, and must match the field names in the environmental & epidemiological datasets.
* `obsfield`: Environmental variable field, and must match the field names in the environmental dataset.
* "week_epidemiar": Week of the year (1 to 52 for CDC, or 1 to 52 or 53 for WHO/ISO).
* "ref_value": Historical mean, or other reference value, for that week of the year for that `groupfield` for that `obsfield`. 


### Reference Data

1. Environmental variables
This file lists the environmental variables and their aggregation method for to create weekly environmental data from daily data, e.g. rainfall could be the 'sum' of the daily values while LST would be the 'mean' value.

* `obsfield`: Give the field name of the environmental data variables, should match the environmental and environmental reference data
* "reference_method": 'sum' or 'mean'
* "report_label": Label to be used in creating the formatted report graphs. This column is not used until the formatting Rnw script, so depending on your setup and how you are have formatting reports after the report data is generated, you may not need this column. 

2. Shapefiles
In order to create summaries from Google Earth Engine, you will need to upload assets of the shapefile of your study area. If you are not using GEE and have some other way of obtaining environmental data, you may not need this. 

If you are creating a formatted report later and wish to have maps of the results, you may need shapefiles for this. 




## Setting up the Report and Model

### Time ranges

* `report_period`: Total number of weeks for the report to include, including the number of future forecast weeks, `forecast_future`. 
* `ed_summary_period`: The last n weeks of known epidemiological data that will be considered the early detection period for alert summaries.
* `forecast_future`: The number of weeks to forecast into the future. It is not recommended to extend the forecast 


### Environmental variables

### Geographic grouping clusters


<<>><<<>>>
2. Model variables and geographic group clusters
This file gives the list of environmental variables to use, and any geographic clustering to be used in the model calculations (e.g. cluster is a variable in the modeling regression). 

* 'vars.1' through 'vars.x' fields, where x is the number of environmental variables to be used in the modeling. The value should correspond to the 'environ_var_id' field in the environmental info reference file. 
* 'cluster.1' through 'cluster.n', where n is the number of geographic units (groupfield values) in the epi/env data. The numeric value of the field name (e.g. 1 of cluster.1) is the 'group_id', or the id value for that geographic unit. The value of the field is the cluster id value, e.g. which cluster the geographic unit belongs to. The 'group_id' crosswalk should be given in the geographic group code file. 

3. Geographic group codes
This file contains a crosswalk of the geographic unit IDs/descriptions. 
* 'group_id' is the ID value corresponding to the cluster information in the model variables and geographic group cluster file. 
* groupfield: is the same given field name for the geographic unit groups when 'run_epidemia()' was called.

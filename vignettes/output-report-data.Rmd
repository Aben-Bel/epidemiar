The results of `run_epidemia()` is a list of the following datasets or objects:

1. `summary_data`: Early detection and early warning alerts levels for each geographic group. Early detection alerts (`ed_alert_count`) are alerts that are triggered during the early detection period, which was defined by the argument `ed_summary_period`, the _n_ most recent weeks of known epidemiology data. Similarly, early warning alerts (`ew_alert_count`) are alerts in the future forecast estimates. “High” level indicates two or more weeks in this period had incidences greater than the alert threshold, “Medium” means that one week was in alert status, and “Low” means no weeks had alerts (`ed_sum_level` and `ew_level`, respectively).

2. `modeling_results_data`:These are multiple timeseries values for observed, forecast, and alert thresholds of disease incidence, over the report period, for each geographic unit. These data can be used in creating the individual geographic unit control charts.

3. `environ_timeseries`: These are multiple timeseries for the used environmental variables during the report period for each geographic unit.

4. `environ_anomalies`: These data are the recent (during the early detection period) differences (anomalies) of the environmental variable values from the climatology/reference mean.

5. `params_meta`: This lists dates, settings, and parameters that `run_epidemiar()` was called with.

6. `regression_object`: This is the regression object from the general additive model (GAM, parallelized with BAM) regression. This is only for statistical investigation of the model, and is usually not saved (large object).
